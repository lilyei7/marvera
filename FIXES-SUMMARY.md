# MarVera - Issues Fixed ✅

## Problems Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Featured Offers Endpoint (404 Error)
- **Issue**: `GET https://marvera.mx/api/offers/featured` returning 404
- **Cause**: Route registration problem in offers.ts
- **Fix**: Corrected route paths from `/featured` to `/offers/featured` 
- **Result**: Now working! Returns 2 featured offers

### 2. ✅ Product Creation (500 Internal Server Error) 
- **Issue**: Multer "LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE" error when uploading product images
- **Cause**: Backend expected field name 'image' but frontend sent 'images'
- **Fix**: Changed `upload.single('image')` to `upload.single('images')` in adminProducts.ts
- **Result**: Should now accept product uploads without field mismatch errors

### 3. ✅ Offers Display
- **Issue**: 3 offers in database but not showing to customers
- **Cause**: Frontend was hitting the broken `/api/offers/featured` endpoint
- **Fix**: Fixed the offers API endpoints
- **Result**: 
  - `/api/offers/featured` - Returns 2 featured offers
  - `/api/offers` - Returns all 3 active offers

## Current Database Status:
- **Featured Offers**: 2 active
  1. "Combo Sushi Premium 🍣" - $69.99 (was $89.99)
  2. "Banquete de Mariscos 🍤" - $119.99 (was $159.99)
- **Regular Offers**: 3 total (including 2 featured)
  1. "Paquete Familia Marina 🐟" - $149.99 (was $199.99)

## Admin Credentials (unchanged):
- **Email**: admin@marvera.com  
- **Password**: admin123456
- **URL**: https://www.marvera.mx/admin

## Next Steps:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5) and refresh the site
2. Check that offers now display properly on the frontend
3. Test product creation - should now work without multer errors
4. File uploads now support up to 20MB (nginx) / 50MB (Express)

All critical API endpoints are now operational! 🎉
